## Mreze

Rails appliction that simulates package flow between IPv6 islands through IPv4 networks. This IPv6 transition method is called [tunneling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol) and it is one of many method used to gradually introduce IPv6 instead of IPv4 protocol.

### Description
It is possible to create various scenarios. Scenario gives user possibility to add and connect nodes (computers, routers) and configure interfaces by setting IP address and IP protocol. Running a scenario will display package flow, packing from IPv4 to IPv6 protocol and vice versa, and showing where invalid package will be discarded.

### Demo
App is hosted on Heroku and can be seen [here](http://ipv6-tunneling-simulation.herokuapp.com/scenarios).
